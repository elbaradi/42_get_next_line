GoodFellas
written by Nicholas Pileggi & Martin Scorsese

(Tommy has just told a story that's cracked up the entire company of gangsters at a table)
Henry: (laughing hard) Really funny. Really funny.
Tommy: Whattya mean I'm funny?
Henry: You're just funny, y'know, the story. It's funny. You're a funny guy.
Tommy: Whattya mean? They way I talk? What?
Henry: It's just, y'know, it's just funny, you know the way you tell the story and everything ...
Tommy: Funny how? I mean, what's funny about it?
Anthony (Frank Adonis): (worried) Tommy, no, you got it all wrong ...
Tommy: Whoa, whoa Anthony! He's a big boy, he knows what he said. What'd you say? Funny how? What?
Henry: Just you know you're funny.
Tommy: You mean, let me understand this ... cuz I ... maybe its me, maybe I'm a little fucked up maybe. I'm funny how, I mean funny, like I'm a clown? I amuse you. I make you laugh? I'm here to fuckin' amuse you? Whattya you mean funny? Funny how? How am I funny?
Henry: I don't know just ... you know how you tell the story. What?
Tommy: No, no I don't know. You said it. How do I know? You said I'm funny. (yelling now) How the fuck am I funny? What the fuck is so funny about me? Tell me. Tell me what's funny?
(Long suspenseful pause: is someone going to die?)
Henry (cracking up): Get the fuck outta here!
(everyone laughs, the tension is gone)
Tommy: Ya motherfucker, I almost had him! I almost had him! You stuttering prick here! Frankie, was he shaking? I wonder about you sometimes, Henry. You may fold under questioning!!
